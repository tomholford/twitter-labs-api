# 0.7.0 - 28 August 2020

- Refactor interface for requesting custom response fields

## Breaking Change

Heads up, the argument to request fields was previously called `tweet_fields`; it is now called `fields`. 

```ruby
api.get_tweet(id: '123455683780', fields: requested_fields)
```

The `fields` parameter now supports multiple different data types (instead of just Tweet attributes). So for example, to request the URL of an embedded media item:

```ruby
requested_fields = { tweet: %w[id username], media: %w[url] }

api.get_tweet(id: my_id, fields: requested_fields)
```
